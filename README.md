The purpose of this work is an an opportunity to use Python to gauge performances of portfolios based on the Coefficient of Variation and Sharpe ratio. 

**Coefficient Variation (CV)**
CV is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data points around the mean. From a financial perspective, CV represents the risk-to-reward ratio. An investor seeks an investment with a lower coefficient because it provides the most optimal risk-to-reward ratio with low volatility but high returns.

**Sharpe ratio**
Also known as Sharpe Index or the reward-to-variability ratio to measure the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk.
The higher the ratio, the greater the investment return relative to its amount of risk, hence the better investment.
